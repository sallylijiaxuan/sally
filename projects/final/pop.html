            <h3>History</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Origins (Early 20th Century):</strong> Pop music, short for "popular music," has its roots in the
                    late 19th and early 20th centuries, emerging from a mix of various musical genres, including
                    vaudeville, Tin Pan Alley songs, and early jazz. The development of recording technology
                    and radio broadcasting played a crucial role in the dissemination of popular music.

                <li>
                    <strong>1940s-1950s:</strong> The Birth of Modern Pop The post-World War II era saw the rise of crooners like
                    Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, whose smooth vocal styles set the stage for modern pop music.
                    The late 1950s introduced rock 'n' roll, a genre blending rhythm and blues with country,
                    popularized by artists like Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard. This era marked
                    the beginning of the youth-driven pop culture phenomenon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1960s:</strong> The British Invasion and Motown The 1960s were a transformative decade for pop music.
                    The British Invasion, led by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Who, brought British
                    rock and pop to international prominence. Meanwhile, in the U.S., Motown Records, founded by
                    Berry Gordy, produced a string of hits by artists like The Supremes, Marvin Gaye,
                    and Stevie Wonder, blending soul and pop.

                    <strong>1970s:</strong> Disco, Glam Rock, and Singer-Songwriters The 1970s saw the rise of diverse pop styles.
                    Disco, with its danceable beats, became a cultural phenomenon thanks to artists like Donna
                    Summer and the Bee Gees. Glam rock, characterized by flamboyant costumes and theatrical
                    performances, was popularized by David Bowie and Elton John. Singer-songwriters like
                    Carole King, James Taylor, and Joni Mitchell brought introspective lyrics and acoustic sounds to the forefront.

                <li>
                    <strong>1980s:</strong> The MTV Era and Synth-Pop The launch of MTV in 1981 revolutionized pop music,
                    emphasizing the visual aspect of music with music videos. Michael Jackson, Madonna,
                    and Prince became pop icons with their innovative videos and performances. Synth-pop,
                    characterized by the use of synthesizers and electronic instruments, was popularized by
                    bands like Depeche Mode, Duran Duran, and A-ha.

                <li>
                    <strong>1990s:</strong> Boy Bands, Girl Groups, and Alternative Pop The 1990s saw the dominance of
                    boy bands and girl groups like Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Spice Girls, who achieved
                    massive commercial success. At the same time, alternative pop and rock gained traction with
                    bands like Nirvana, Radiohead, and Alanis Morissette, blending pop sensibilities with edgier sounds.

                    <strong>2000s:</strong> Digital Revolution and Pop Divas The 2000s were marked by the digital revolution,
                    with the rise of the internet, MP3s, and platforms like iTunes changing how music was consumed.
                    Pop divas like Britney Spears, Beyoncé, and Lady Gaga dominated the charts, known for their
                    vocal prowess and stage presence. Hip-hop and R&B influences became more prominent in
                    mainstream pop, with artists like Justin Timberlake and Rihanna blending genres.

                <li>
                    <strong>2010s-Present:</strong> Globalization and Streaming Era The 2010s and beyond have seen the
                    globalization of pop music, with artists from around the world gaining international fame.
                    The advent of streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music revolutionized music
                    distribution and consumption. Artists like Taylor Swift, Drake, and Ariana Grande have
                    consistently topped the charts. K-pop, led by groups like BTS and BLACKPINK, has become a
                    global phenomenon, reflecting the increasingly interconnected nature of the music industry.
