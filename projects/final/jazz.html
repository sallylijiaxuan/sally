                            <li>
                                <strong>Origins (Late 19th Century - Early 20th Century):</strong> Jazz originated in the late 19th
                                and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, Louisiana, a melting pot of cultures and musical
                                traditions. It drew from African American musical styles, including blues, ragtime,
                                and spirituals, as well as European military band music. Key characteristics of early jazz
                                include syncopation, improvisation, and a strong rhythm section.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Early Jazz and Dixieland (1910s-1920s):</strong> Early jazz, often referred to as Dixieland,
                                emerged in the early 1900s. New Orleans bands like the Original Dixieland Jass Band
                                popularized this style with their 1917 recording "Livery Stable Blues." Prominent figures
                                include Louis Armstrong, whose virtuosic trumpet playing and charismatic presence
                                significantly shaped the genre.

                                <strong>The Jazz Age and Swing Era (1920s-1940s):</strong> The 1920s, known as the Jazz Age,
                                saw jazz spread across the United States and become a dominant cultural force.
                                This period was characterized by the rise of big bands and the development of the swing
                                style. Notable bandleaders like Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Benny Goodman brought jazz
                                to a broader audience. The swing era, peaking in the 1930s and 1940s, featured large
                                ensembles, arranged compositions, and prominent soloists.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Bebop (1940s-1950s):</strong> In the 1940s, bebop emerged as a reaction against the commercialism of
                                swing. This style, spearheaded by musicians like Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie,
                                and Thelonious Monk, emphasized fast tempos, complex harmonies, and virtuosic improvisation.
                                Bebop shifted jazz from dance music to a form of art music intended for listening.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Cool Jazz and Hard Bop (1950s-1960s):</strong> The 1950s saw the development of cool jazz,
                                characterized by relaxed tempos and lighter tones. Key figures include Miles Davis,
                                whose album "Birth of the Cool" epitomized this style, and Dave Brubeck. Hard bop,
                                which emerged around the same time, was a return to the roots of jazz, incorporating
                                elements of blues, gospel, and rhythm and blues. Art Blakey and Horace Silver were leading
                                figures in this movement.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Modal Jazz and Free Jazz (1960s):</strong> The 1960s introduced modal jazz, which focused on scales
                                (modes) rather than chord progressions. Miles Davis’s album "Kind of Blue" is a landmark of
                                this style. Around the same time, free jazz, pioneered by musicians like Ornette Coleman and
                                John Coltrane, broke away from traditional structures and embraced avant-garde approaches,
                                emphasizing collective improvisation and experimentation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Fusion (1970s):</strong> In the 1970s, jazz fusion blended jazz with rock, funk, and electronic music.
                                Miles Davis’s "Bitches Brew" is a seminal work in this genre. Bands like Weather Report,
                                Mahavishnu Orchestra, and Return to Forever pushed the boundaries of jazz, incorporating
                                electric instruments and rock-influenced rhythms.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Contemporary Jazz (1980s-Present):</strong> Since the 1980s, jazz has continued to evolve,
                                incorporating a wide range of influences and styles. The neo-bop movement, led by artists
                                like Wynton Marsalis, sought to return to traditional jazz forms. Meanwhile, artists like
                                Herbie Hancock and Pat Metheny explored new sonic territories. Contemporary jazz includes a
                                diverse array of subgenres, from smooth jazz and Latin jazz to jazz rap and electronic jazz.
