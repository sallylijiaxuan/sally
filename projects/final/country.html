            <h3>History</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong> Origins (Early 20th Century): </strong>Country music originated in the early 20th century in the rural Southern United States, drawing from folk, Western, and blues traditions. Early pioneers like Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family laid the foundation with their simple, heartfelt songs.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1940s-1950s:</strong>Honky Tonk and Western Swing: The post-World War II era saw the rise of honky tonk, with artists like Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell bringing a raw, emotional edge to country music. Western swing, a danceable blend of country and jazz, also gained popularity, with Bob Wills as a leading figure.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1960s:</strong> Nashville Sound and Outlaw Country: The 1960s introduced the Nashville Sound, characterized by smooth productions and orchestral arrangements, with artists like Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves. At the same time, the outlaw country movement, led by Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings, rebelled against the polished Nashville sound, embracing a grittier, more authentic style.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1970s:</strong> Country Pop and Southern Rock: The 1970s saw the fusion of country and pop music, with artists like Glen Campbell and Dolly Parton achieving crossover success. Southern rock, blending country with rock elements, also emerged, with bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Allman Brothers Band.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong> 1980s: </strong> Urban Cowboy and Neotraditionalism: The 1980s were marked by the Urban Cowboy movement, popularized by the film of the same name, which brought a more polished, pop-oriented sound to country music. At the same time, neotraditionalism, led by artists like George Strait and Randy Travis, returned to the genre's traditional roots.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong> 1990s: </strong> Country Boom and Crossover Success: The 1990s saw a country music boom, with artists like Garth Brooks, Shania Twain, and Alan Jackson achieving massive commercial success. This era also saw significant crossover appeal, with country music influencing and being influenced by pop and rock.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong> 2000s-Present: </strong> Contemporary Country and Bro-Country: The 2000s and beyond have seen the rise of contemporary country, with artists like Carrie Underwood, Keith Urban, and Luke Bryan blending traditional country with modern pop and rock elements. Bro-country, a subgenre characterized by party-themed lyrics and hip-hop influences, also gained popularity with artists like Florida Georgia Line and Jason Aldean.
