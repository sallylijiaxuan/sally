                <li id="o1">
                    <span class="word">Slice</span> your onion. Start by slicing off the top of a large onion with a sharp knife,
                    then peel away the outer layers of papery skin.
                    Carefully slice the onion into discs that are between ¼" and ½" wide on a cutting board,
                    then separate them into individual rings.
                </li>
                <li id="o2">
                    Prepare dredging stations. Gather three shallow bowls or shallow dishes.
                    In one, combine flour, cornstarch, smoked paprika, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
                    Pour the buttermilk into another dish, and add the Panko breadcrumbs to the third.
                </li>
                <li id="o3">
                    <span class="word">Dredge</span> in flour, then buttermilk.
                </li>
                <li id="o4">
                    <span class="word">Coat</span> in breadcrumbs. Let the buttermilk drip off the onion rings for a sec
                    before transferring them to the bowl of breadcrumbs. Toss to coat the onion rings all over.
                    You might want to press a few breadcrumbs in to make sure you get a solid coating.
                </li>
                <li id="o5">
                    Heat oil. Heat 1- to 2-inches of oil to between 350 and 375 degrees Fahrenheit over medium-high heat.
                </li>
                <li id="o6">
                    <span class="word">Fry</span> onion rings. Work in batches to from 4-6 onion rings in a single layer at a time without overcrowding the pan.
                    Fry each batch of onion rings for 2-3 minutes or until they are golden brown and crisp.
                    Carefully transfer them with tongs or a slotted wire spatula for frying to a wire rack set
                    over a baking sheet lined with paper towels to soak up any excess oil that drips off.
                    Repeat until all of the onion rings have been fried.
